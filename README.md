# accessibilityQuiz
An accessibility quiz built on FreeCodeCamp:

This accessibility quiz i built (with the help of the teachers) on FreeCodeCamp is an interactive web application designed to test users' knowledge and understanding of web accessibility principles and practices ensuring that people with disabilities can access and use them effectively.

Building this accessibility quiz on FreeCodeCamp was an excellent way to reinforce my own understanding of accessibility as I learn about this crucial aspect of web development. It contributes to a more inclusive web and empower developers to create websites that can be accessed by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

I had fun building this that I had to put it up on my repository for refrences purposes.
